// I want to change the value of a variable when clicking on an specific html element.
// To do that I have created a div with several buttons on it with different
// idÂ´s. Everytime a button is clicked, the value of the variable changes and
// an alert is displayed showing the id of the button clicked and the new value assigned

var onClickButton=''
