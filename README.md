# __Tourtrip Project__ 

<!-- It is based on all the learnings acquired through the initial three modules or the Fullstack Web Developer (Code Institute).

It is about an imaginary rock band from California from the 70's and the user can review their albums, past and future events and videoclips. It also allows the user to keep in contact with the band providing their feedback via mail and, if interested, buy event tickets or hire the band for private events.

This site is simulating all the previous features and all its content are pure fiction. Every content has been researched, collected and edited from many different sites around the World Wide Web. -->

## __Features__

### __*Existing features*__

### __*Features Left to Implement*__

## __Technologies Used__
---

<!-- + __*Bootstrap v3.3.7 and jQuery v3.2.1:*__

  But after various attempts to implement the carrousel only with HTML and CSS, it became an 'horrendous' visual feature for the project so I decided to implement a generic example from Bootstrap and adapt its code to make it functional for the site. This feature has been implemented to index.html("The Albums"), pict.html ("The concerts"), events.html ("Upcoming Events"). -->


+ __*Code editors:*__ 

  Exclusively a local IDE has been used along the development of this project. VS Code has made the difference, allowing me to code locally in different computers while commuting to work every day...

  - [Visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

<!-- + __*Autoprefix:*__ 

  To optimize CSS styles and make it work properly in different browsers, I parsed it and added vendor prefixes using the next links and plugins:

  - [Autoprefixer CSS online](https://autoprefixer.github.io/)

  - [Autoprefixer - VS Code plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mrmlnc.vscode-autoprefixer) -->
  

+ __*Disclaimer generator:*__

  To generate a disclaimer about the educational purpose of this project, I have used the generic disclaimer linked below. I copied, pasted and edited the text at the bottom of this file.

## __Deployment__
---

This project has been committed and pushed frequently to a GitHub repository named [tourtrip](https://github.com/danmtt/tourtrip). It is published to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) using the GitHub settings. [Click here to visit the site](https://danmtt.github.io/rockanrolla).

This project has been developed using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) committing the changes in the project to git and also pushing and pulling between two different machines, a laptop and a tower pc, to be as productive as possible while commuting to work and after locally at home. Learning about how to resolve the technical issues using its [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) helped me to develop the project quicker than before.

In order to achieve this and deploy this page to GitHub Pages from its GitHub repository, these are the steps I followed:

+ Using Cloud9 IDE I created a repository for the project. Then I worked on its file structure and the initial code in the different files. Then I initialized git and made an initial commit using the console and these commands:
  - git init
  - git commit -m"Commit update explanation"Project structure Update / Readme.md"
+ After this, I created a repository in my GitHub user account to upload the project. It can be found online as [rockanrolla](https://github.com/danmtt/rockanrolla).
+ From Cloud9 IDE console I set up and pushed up the existing repository to the master branch using these commands: 
  - git remote add origin https://github.com/danmtt/rockanrolla
  - git push -u origin master-
+ After providing the right user name and password, the project uploaded correctly to GitHub
and I could regularly keep up committing its changes using these commands from Cloud9:
  - git commit -m"Commit update explanation"
  - git push
+ To set up the page into GitHub pages, on my GitHub user main page I selected the rockanrolla repository. Then on its project home page I clicked on settings, scrolled down to the GitHub pages section, selected the source (master-branch) and after a few seconds, automatically the site was deployed. 
As explained, I started using VS Code after a while and for that I had to clone the project from GitHub. So if the project needs to run locally and any developer is interested about how to do this, the next steps explain how to do it:

+ On my GitHub user main page, [danmtt](https://github.com/danmtt), select the rockanrolla repository. 
+ Then on the project home page, click on 'Clone or Download' and copy the clone URL for the repository.
+ In your local IDE open a terminal and change the current working directory to the location where you want to clone the project.
+ Type the next command and paste the url copied after it. It should be:
  - git clone https://github.com/danmtt/rockanrolla.git
+ Press Enter and the project should start to clone itself into that directory.

If any issue comes up after following these steps, please read the next [documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository).

At the moment of submitting this project the development branch and the master branch are exactly the same.
