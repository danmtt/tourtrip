# __Rockanrolla Band Project__ 

*__This is my very first Website Project.__*

It is based on all the learnings acquired through the initial three modules or the Fullstack Web Developer (Code Institute).

It is about an imaginary rock band from California from the 70's and the user can review their albums, past and future events and videoclips. It also allows the user to keep in contact with the band providing their feedback via mail and, if interested, buy event tickets or hire the band for private events.

This site is simulating all the previous features and all its content are pure fiction. Every content has been researched, collected and edited from many different sites around the World Wide Web.


## __UX__
---

This website is aim to be visited by music and rock fans, more specifically those that grown up listening those beats during the 70's and 80's. This site shows the progress of the band from then till these actual days. 

__*Average visitor should probably be:*__

- Between 20 and 80 year old. This is a wide range, but music is for all ages.

- Music / Rock and roll lover.

- Curious about rock history.

- Engaged with concerts and live events.

__*Most of the visitors to this site are probably looking for:*__

- Valuable information about the band that made them dance, sing and feel like no other during a single concert or an event.

- New ways to keep in touch with their favourite music band.

- Listen to the band's songs easily and without paying for it.

__*This site could help them to feel part of the crowd again:*__

- The easy menu allows visitors to navigate between the site pages

- Many other music bands overload the sites with sponsors. This doesn't happen in this site. Visitor's attention is directly put to work with the different contents. On this site, the band is the main sponsor!

- Some past events are included and displayed in a time line. This should encourage visitors to update their experiences when attending to a concert that is not displayed on the site.

- Some songs of the band are ready to be played with only one click. This quick way should engage new and experienced fans to listen to their music and keep the clips.html link saved between their favourites.

__*Visitors experiences:*__ New and repeating visitors shoul be between the ones that navigate the site. Some of their intentions are represented below:

- As a new visitor to this page I would like to navigate through the contents in an easy way.

- As a new visitor to this page I would like to find some pictures of previous and future events of this band.

- As a new visitor to this page I would like to listen to some music from this band.

- As a fan of this band I would like to be able to give some feedback about my feelings during a concert I attended.

- As a fan of this band I would like to buy a ticket for a concert.

- As a fan of this band I would like to follow the band through social media sites.
  
__*Wireframes mockups:*__ 

Trying to approach the best way to navigate the site and its contents, I started first designing some drafts by hand and then worked with an online application.

## __Features__
---

The site works on 5 HTML pages styles using Flexbox and customized CSS properties to feature a responsive design. 

On each page the next *[existing features](###existing-features)* with *[specific contents](###specific-section-contents)* are displayed with an open mind, in a responsive way and always opening the door to [implement them](###features-left-to-implement)

  - A __*header*__ containing a [band logo](https://manitobamusicmuseum.webs.com/The%20Guess%20Who%201972-74.jpg), a title and a navigation menu between pages.

  - A *__section__* with two columns displaying the contents related to the page selected.

  - A __*footer*__ that shows the fan club address and links the visitor to the band via social media as also to the [developer's resume](https://danmtt.github.io/ucd-resume/index.html) (under construction).

  - A __*back to top button*__ that allows the visitor to go back to the header.

### __*Existing features*__

+ __*Header:*__ Exist on every page and it is a key feature for the visitor experience when navigating through the site. It is responsive and displayed in a very simple way.
  
  - __*Band Logo*__. A simple [picture](https://manitobamusicmuseum.webs.com/The%20Guess%20Who%201972-74.jpg) showing the band in its best cheerful moment.

  - __*Band Name*__. A title displaying the band name. This title is invented and has got nothing to do with rock and roll bands but with a [special racehorse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasor_(horse)) named like that. One of my best friends loves this horse because he is a winner, so this honors their friendship in a way...

  - __*Responsive navigation menu*__. It adapts to the different devices used by the visitor to display the site.

+ __*Section:*__  Exist on every page and it is a key feature for the visitor experience when looking for contents the site. Contains two columns with different 'ingredients' each. They are displayed as a column in small devices and in a row in bigger ones (left and right). Every different page uses different contents using:

  - __*Carousels*__. A simple way to display cards with images and/or information about the band. The interaction with the screen make it particularly valuable on the Mobile Approach due to its quickness and easy use. A transformation on the size of every card is triggered when hovering on it. These carousels, displayed on the left of the section on Tablets and Laptops with bigger screens, gave me the chance to have space available to display more information about the band in the right area of the screen. This could be a feature to implement in the future so I recognize that there is still space available on the right columns... 

  - __*Articles*__. Used along different columns to display the specific content related to the page visited with paragraphs / spans containing information about the band, feedback from fans, and links to videoclips and other sites to buy tickets and, if wished, also hire the band for private events.

  - __*Forms*__. With inputs and textareas to make it easy to the visitor to contact the band and give feedback.

  - __*Div elements*__. With CSS animations defined and links to show .mp4 videoclips targeting a common iframe, easy to play and giving the chance to the visitor to listen to some songs from the band. 

+ __*Footer:*__ Exist on every page and it is a key feature for the visitor experience when connecting to the band in different social media platforms. It is responsive and displayed in a very simple way.

  - __*Band PO box*__. A box showing the PO address of the band to allow visitors to write mail letters to the band. This is a vintage feature added to the site. Some fans still rely on written old-style feedback, as the band itself.
  
  - __*Developer link*__. An image that links the visitor to the [developer's resume](https://danmtt.github.io/ucd-resume/index.html) (under construction). It displays a cube in 3d that rotates 360 degrees when hovered. This is a special feature that I would like to include in every project in the future.

  - __*Social media platform's icons*__. A box containing three links to connect the visitor to the different social media profiles of the band. This way they should receive current news and posts, increasing the chances to interact with the band.

+ __*Back to top button:*__ A button that only exist on Mobile approach and helps the customer to navigate back to the page header and then easily navigate to another page of the site.

### __*Specific Section contents*__

+ __*Home:*__

  - The contents displayed in the first column of this section are about all the band's albums. A carrousel containing seven slides with the album cover and some of the song titles should help the visitor to meet the band's discography.

  - The contents displayed in the second column are about the beginnig of the band's history. In a simple article element containing a header and two paragraphs, the visitor should be able to learn about the beginning of the band and why, after all this time, they are still together.

+ __*Pictures:*__

  - The contents displayed on the first column of this section are about the band's concerts. A carrousel displays nine cards, every one containing an image and some information about a concert in a world venue. These cards are ordered by year to show the visitor the band progress through the years.  

  - The contents displayed on the second column are about feedback from events provided by fans that attended some of the concerts of the band.

+ __*Clips:*__

  - The contents displayed on the first column of this section are about the band's concert song recordings. A menu displays four divs and an iframe. Every div contains a title of a song and it links to a videoclip of that song recorded live and stored in the assets folder. Hovering on them triggers an animation and clicking on them displays the videoclip of that song in the frame below.

  - The contents displayed on the second column are about an specific videoclip that is compared to another band's song. This is the first videoclip recorded by the band and works as the divs in the first column. In the information provided in the article appear two links targeting also the displaying frame. The hovering animation here is replaced by a change on the color of the text. This aims to allow the visitor to compare quickly both songs.

+ __*Events:*__

  - The contents displayed on the first column of this section are about the future events of the band. A carrousel is available with six cards, each one containing information about a future event date, weekday, city, country, venue. Tickets availability is delivered with a barcode image and colored text over it (green or red). This should help the fans to take a decision about which should be the best concert to attend.

  - The contents displayed on the second column are related to the purchase of concerts tickets. A link is displayed that should help to link the visitors to an external site where tickets can be bought.

+ __*Contact:*__

  - The contents displayed on the first column of this section are about the form available for the visitor to give any kind of feedback about the band, their concerts, etc. A validated name and email is necessary to send the feedback so this would give the band crew to give back a response, increasing the confidence between the musicians and the fans.

  - The contents displayed on the second column are about the chance given to any fan to hire the band for music events. This is managed through an external company so the visitor is offer a link to it if this is their desire.


### __*Features Left to Implement*__

+ __*Landing page:*__ As shown in [Balsamiq Project wireframe](assets/project_docs/Wireframes/Balsamiq_wireframe_Rockanrolla_project.pdf), the project was originally planned over 6 HTML pages. A landing page should be the perfect way to introduce images of the band as also some random song from their extended repertoire.

+ __*Implement contents in quantity and quality on section's columns:*__ The visual available space on some of the right columns, in pages index.html, events.html and contact.html, and on the left column in clips.html is a chance to include more contents about the band. 

+ __*Ticket / Band Hiring management:*__ Actually the band use external companies to manage this features. A challenge for every band is to manage this independently so no external control over them is imposed by the ticketing industry.

+ __*Better design adapted to specific devices:*__ As a challenge to learn more about design, this site could always be improved. Typography types, sizes and colors as the same applied to backgrounds and other elements are qualities that display in different ways in different devices.  Also the responsive design and the breakpoints in media queries are always changing with the new devices releases, so yes, this all could be a future implementation to keep in mind.

## __Technologies Used__
---

The site has been developed using programming languages as HTML5 with semantic tags and CSS3 with Flex grid properties. The main reason to select this grid instead Bootstrap was the challenge to learn how to code more 'directly', without the support of libraries.

Nevertheless at some point while optimizing the code for the carousels, Bootstrap with jQuery was the most obvious solution and was implemented to make them work properly. 

This mixture between Flex as main and Bootstrap as secondary has been a challenge for a new developer as I, but the learnings from this sure will help in future projects. 

+ __*"Our own thing" - Font research and design:*__

  This site uses [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to style its fonts. Some font mockups have been created using [Our own thing](http://www.ourownthing.co.uk/fontpairing/):

  + [Font mockup 01](assets/project_docs/Font_selection_research/01_Blue_White_Monoton.jpg)

  + [Font mockup 02](assets/project_docs/Font_selection_research/01_Blue_White_Ranchers.jpg)

  + [Font mockup 08](assets/project_docs/Font_selection_research/04_White_Black_Monoton_Ranchers_Combo.jpg)

+ __*Balsamiq tool for wireframes design:*__ 

  On the The next web tool I signed into a first free month subscription and it has been used to develop and learn how to do web mockups. Nevertheless, post-it colored sticks, A4 and pencils, and a whiteboard have been my best friends along the project. 

  - [Balsamiq wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/index.html)
 
+ __*Flexbox:*__

  The next 'How to' documentation has been researched and coding examples edited from this sites:

  - [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
  
  - [w3school - CSS Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp)

  - [Scrimba - Flexbox](https://scrimba.com/g/gflexbox)

+ __*CSS Tricks and QNimate documentation:*__

  In a first attempt, the next 'How to' documentation from the sites below has been researched and coding examples edited to develop the carousels along the site:

  - [Slider with just HTML and CSS](https://css-tricks.com/can-get-pretty-far-making-slider-just-html-css/)

  - [Image Slider Using HTML And CSS Only](http://qnimate.com/creating-a-slider-using-html-and-css-only/)
    
+ __*Bootstrap v3.3.7 and jQuery v3.2.1:*__

  But after various attempts to implement the carrousel only with HTML and CSS, it became an 'horrendous' visual feature for the project so I decided to implement a generic example from Bootstrap and adapt its code to make it functional for the site. This feature has been implemented to index.html("The Albums"), pict.html ("The concerts"), events.html ("Upcoming Events").

  - [Bootstrap Carousel with javascript](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/javascript/#carousel-examples)

+ __*Stackoverflow Documentation: Back to top button :*__ 

  The next 'How to' documentation has been researched and coding examples edited from this site:

  - [Back to top button using CSS and HTML only](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32102747/how-to-make-a-back-to-top-button-using-css-and-html-only)

+ __*Code editors:*__ 

  Two different editors have been used along the development of this project. Cloud9 gave me the starting point about how to code online but VS Code has made the difference, allowing me to code locally in different computers while commuting to work every day...

  - [Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/es/cloud9/?origin=c9io)

  - [Visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

+ __*Autoprefix:*__ 

  To optimize CSS styles and make it work properly in different browsers, I parsed it and added vendor prefixes using the next links and plugins:

  - [Autoprefixer CSS online](https://autoprefixer.github.io/)

  - [Autoprefixer - VS Code plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mrmlnc.vscode-autoprefixer)
  

+ __*Disclaimer generator:*__

  To make the site as much legal as possible, simulating the real world, I doubted about using a proper license from the link below: 

  - [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/)

  But to simplify the task I looked for a generic disclaimer as the one in the link below to have the job done easily. I copied, pasted and edited the text at the bottom of this file. This is something to learn in the oncoming projects, I suppose.

## __Deployment__
---

This project was developed in the beginning using the [Cloud9 IDE](https://aws.amazon.com/es/cloud9/?origin=c9ioand) committed regularly to git and pushed using its built in functionality. To achieve that info researched from its [documentation](https://docs.c9.io/docs) has been of great value.

After the different challenges during the project development, I learnt about a more effective way of working on it. After having committed more or less two-thirds of them i started using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) committing the changes in the project to git and also pushing and pulling between two different machines, a laptop and a tower pc, to be as productive as possible while commuting to work and after locally at home. This has make a big impact in the project. Learning about how to resolve the technical issues using its [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) helped me to develop the project quicker than before.

As explained, using those tools, the project was staged, committed and pushed frequently to a GitHub repository named [rockanrolla](https://github.com/danmtt/rockanrolla). It is published to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) using the GitHub settings.

In order to achieve this and deploy this page to GitHub Pages from its GitHub repository, these are the steps I followed:

+ Using Cloud9 IDE I created a repository for the project. Then I worked on its file structure and the initial code in the different files. Then I initialized git and made an initial commit using the console and these commands:
  - git init
  - git commit -m"Commit update explanation"Project structure Update / Readme.md"
+ After this, I created a repository in my GitHub user account to upload the project. It can be found online as [rockanrolla](https://github.com/danmtt/rockanrolla).
+ From Cloud9 IDE console I set up and pushed up the existing repository to the master branch using these commands: 
  - git remote add origin https://github.com/danmtt/rockanrolla
  - git push -u origin master-
+ After providing the right user name and password, the project uploaded correctly to GitHub
and I could regularly keep up committing its changes using these commands from Cloud9:
  - git commit -m"Commit update explanation"
  - git push
+ To set up the page into GitHub pages, on my GitHub user main page I selected the rockanrolla repository. Then on its project home page I clicked on settings, scrolled down to the GitHub pages section, selected the source (master-branch) and after a few seconds, automatically the site was deployed. [Click here to visit the site](https://danmtt.github.io/rockanrolla).

As explained, I started using VS Code after a while and for that I had to clone the project from GitHub. So if the project needs to run locally and any developer is interested about how to do this, the next steps explain how to do it:

+ On my GitHub user main page, [danmtt](https://github.com/danmtt), select the rockanrolla repository. 
+ Then on the project home page, click on 'Clone or Download' and copy the clone URL for the repository.
+ In your local IDE open a terminal and change the current working directory to the location where you want to clone the project.
+ Type the next command and paste the url copied after it. It should be:
  - git clone https://github.com/danmtt/rockanrolla.git
+ Press Enter and the project should start to clone itself into that directory.

If any issue comes up after following these steps, please read the next [documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository).

At the moment of submitting this project the development branch and the master branch are exactly the same.
